My name is **Ryan Caro**. This is my project.

Rent prices in LA by census tract, 2010-2016 at [Neighborhood Data for Social Change](https://usc.data.socrata.com/Los-Angeles/Rent-Price-LA-/4a97-v5tx). This data can be used to visualize where rent is highest in LA and where it has grown the most from 2010 to 2016. It can be visualized as a choropleth on a map of census trats in LA.

Commute mode in LA by census tract, 2010-2018 at [Neighborhood Data for Social Change](https://usc.data.socrata.com/Los-Angeles/Commute-Mode-LA-/ff5n-m9wp). This data can be used to visualize how transit/bike/pedestrian commutes have changed over the last decade. It would be fun to combine this with a map of transit in the city, or with a map of median income.
