## Week 4 Individual Assignment: Humanitarian Mapathon

After learning how to use HotOSM and mapping 100 buildings, I am in awe of the amount of work that has gone into OSM. 

After doing the mapping project, I looked on Google to see if I could learn more about the area I worked on [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sidja,+Area+Kebun%2FHutan,+Sengon,+Subah,+Batang+Regency,+Central+Java,+Indonesia/@-6.945441,109.8192474,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x2e703c3bfeed22cf:0x8a7e319c501cdfbe!8m2!3d-6.9454856!4d109.8367998).
