Joe Linton, ["LADOT Seeking Input on Low-Stress Travel Corridors in Central Los Angeles."](https://la.streetsblog.org/2020/09/23/ladot-seeking-input-on-low-stress-travel-corridors-in-central-los-angeles/) *Streetsblog*, September 23, 2020. 

The L.A. City Department of Transportation (LADOT) is creating a [map of low-stress corridors](https://lahub.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=75c7710f6f5845aa9c44cffd1a134b2a) in central LA, streets with less traffic that are more comfortable for biking and walking. LADOT has made a preliminary map "based on community input and professional analysis" but is currently seeking public comment. It will use the map to find gaps in the low-stress network that can be filled in with traffic interventions to make biking and walking easier. 

When I saw this article, and the project behind it, on *Streetsblog* last week, I was immediately interested because it shows the power of spatial analysis to identify easy fixes. It would be much more difficult to find small interruptions in low-stress corridors based purely on written or oral survey results, but by mapping them it becomes much easier. Selfishly, the LADOT map has also validated my experiences as a frequent biker on Pico and San Vicente Boulevards. I would be interested to see this map combined with other spatial data to answer more questions. For example, overlaying this data with income data could show if low-stress streets are more prevalent in high-income areas. Adding commute data could also show which high-stress areas to prioritize so that the low-stress network can serve the greatest number of people.
