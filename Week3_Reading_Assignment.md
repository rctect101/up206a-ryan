While reading “Off the Grid…”, I was immediately excited to see that Boeing was the author of the (2019 paper on street network orientation)[ https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-019-0189-1] which contained the polar histograms that were all over the urbanist blogs. I was impressed that Boeing was able to combine property age data with street map data to trace the changes in street grids over time. I hadn’t considered street data as accessible, but after reading both papers and learning about OSMnx, I feel that it could be a valuable addition to our project on transit use and rent prices. I did wonder, however, if Boeing’s study pays more attention to land than to people. For example, Boeing mentions that in the Northeast, griddedness only occurs in urban areas, whereas rural areas are least gridlike. However, proportionally more people live in the urban areas, so the average person in the Northeast likely experiences a more gridded environment than simply looking at the map would suggest. 

When I first read the Boeing’s paper, “OSMnx: New methods for acquiring, constructing, analyzing, and visualizing complex street networks,” I was reminded of the 2014 study by Rémi Louf and Marc Barthelemy, (“A typology of street patterns”)[ https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2094], in which they analyzed the street grids of 131 cities to create a classification of cities. Since African, Asian, and Latin American cities were significantly underrepresented in that study, I would love to see the authors use OSMnx to rerun the study with data from more cities to see if the results hold. This would be especially interesting since two cities, Mogadishu and Buenos Aires, were the only cities in their classes.

Questions: 
* Would it be possible to weight the analysis in “Off the Grid” by population density, so that we can see the change in the griddedness of the average American’s neighborhood over time, rather than the griddedness of new construction? Do you see any methodological pitfalls there?
* If you were Director of Planning for LA County, how would you use the insights in “Off the Grid…” to change the built environment here?
