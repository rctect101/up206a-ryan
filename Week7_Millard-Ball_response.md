## Conversation Series for Week 8: Adam Millard-Ball

This week I read "Parking search caused congestion: Whereâ€™s all the fuss?" by Rachel R. Weinberger, Adam Millard-Ball, and Robert C. Hampshire. 


I also took a look at "Global trends toward urban street-network sprawl" with Christopher Barrington-Leigh. I was really impressed that they were able to use OSM to get data from so many cities. This was particularly exciting to me since in Week 3 we saw some readings that were heavily weighted towards North America and Europe. I love that the open data source allows us a much more representative sample of cities!
