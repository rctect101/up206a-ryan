My name is **Ryan Caro**. I am a first-year Master in Urban and Regional Planning student at UCLA, concentrating in transportation. I am interested in more equitable transportation systems, particularly buses and bikes and their ability to solve transit problems where rail is too expensive or politically infeasible. I am also interested in how transit makes housing more or less affordable.
