My name is **Ryan Caro**. This is my project.

Rent prices in LA by census tract, 2010-2016 at [Neighborhood Data for Social Change](https://usc.data.socrata.com/Los-Angeles/Rent-Price-LA-/4a97-v5tx)
This data can be used to visualize where rent is highest in LA and where it has grown the most from 2010 to 2016. It can be visualized as a choropleth on a map of census trats in LA.
