## Week 4 Individual Assignment: Humanitarian Mapathon

After learning how to use HotOSM and mapping 100 buildings, I am in awe of the amount of work that has gone into OSM. In Monday's class I looked at Istanbul, Sao Paulo, and Viterbo (Italy), and all three cities were fully mapped. Somehow I didn't realize that someone went through and outlined every single building in those places. They probably had better satelite imagery, but it is still a tremendous amount of work. I think I had assumed part of the work was automated, but I can see that it wasn't. Since this is so time-consuming, it seems like someone should be paid to do it, and it would make sense for those people to be local residents. I wonder if there have been any projects to hire local workers to digitize their own cities.

After doing the mapping project, I looked on Google to see if I could learn more about the area I worked on [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sidja,+Area+Kebun%2FHutan,+Sengon,+Subah,+Batang+Regency,+Central+Java,+Indonesia/@-6.945441,109.8192474,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x2e703c3bfeed22cf:0x8a7e319c501cdfbe!8m2!3d-6.9454856!4d109.8367998). Surprisingly, Google has Streeview on several main roads running through the area I worked on. (I had a feeling [this building](https://www.google.com/maps/@-6.9522008,109.837184,3a,75y,299.54h,107.8t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1scSUJvwXDUsZl0wZmKlObgQ!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo0.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DcSUJvwXDUsZl0wZmKlObgQ%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D147.22304%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192) was a mosque, which Streetview confirmed.) More surprisingly, Google had outlines for many (though not all) buildings. I wonder what technology Google is using to outline them and what it would take to get them to share it with OSM.
