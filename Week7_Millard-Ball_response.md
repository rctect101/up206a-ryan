## Conversation Series for Week 8: Adam Millard-Ball

This week I read "Parking search caused congestion: Whereâ€™s all the fuss?" by Rachel R. Weinberger, Adam Millard-Ball, and Robert C. Hampshire. It was a good exercise in learning to accept data that contradicts my biases, since as a self-certified footsoldier in the War on Cars I am generally inclined to believe anything that shows that cars are evil (or at least wasting a lot of gas doing useless things like looking for traffic). Plus, we're all Shoupistas here at UCLA! More importantly, it was really cool to see how the team overcame all of the complications in using GPS data. There were so many twists and turns; I certainly would have given up and just returned to surveys. I wonder if a service like Google Maps or Apple Maps could be used to improve this analysis, since they know the destination that users have put into the map. (I mean, they definitely have the data. The question is if there is a way to get them to do the analysis or just hand over the data.) 

I also took a look at "Global trends toward urban street-network sprawl" with Christopher Barrington-Leigh. I was really impressed that they were able to use OSM to get data from so many cities. This was particularly exciting to me since in Week 3 we saw some readings that were heavily weighted towards North America and Europe. I love that the open data source allows us a much more representative sample of cities!

Some questions for Adam:
* You parking analysis questions some of the core assumptions that Shoup et all make. Does you analysis change how you think about their conclusions and policy suggestions?
* Off-topic but still important: Can you tell us more about the classes you'll be teaching starting next quarter?
