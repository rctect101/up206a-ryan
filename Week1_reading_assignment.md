This article, and the project behind it, spoke to me because it shows the power of spatial analysis to identify easy fixes. It would be much more difficult to find small interruptions in low-stress corridors based purely on written or oral survey results, but by mapping them it becomes much easier. Selfishly, the LADOT map has also validated my experiences as a frequent biker on Pico and San Vicente Boulevards.
